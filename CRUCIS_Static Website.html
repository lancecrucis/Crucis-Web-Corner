                <p>Welcome to my college at Cavite State University! Here at this university, the very first thing I experienced was comfortability. I can be myself without the huge crowds unlike other universities. I hope to leave my mark on this university.</p>

                    <p class="ugamestext">I didn’t expect I would play at the university games at CVSU at only being a first-year student. This is due to my thinking that I would only study at this university and have doubts about joining. But to my suprise it was all worth it. I didn’t expect to have a lot of fun even though we lost at a standing of 2-2 lost to another Cavite State University campus. The experience I got did not compare to the loss we got since it was a fun journey, made a lot of friends, and made me see the world in a new light with new things I experienced. Overall I would like to take apart in it again.</p>

            <p class="hi">The constant losses I experienced this year were too much for me to handle, to the point where I would cry at night, questioning why I’m so weak at this sport and always lose, even though I gave my all each and every day to become better. But this year, I promise to still have fun and not pressure myself to get stronger too quickly. Instead, I’ll focus on enjoying every moment of the journey.</p>
